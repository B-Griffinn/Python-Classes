# Python-Classes

My introduction to Python Classes

I found this great YouTube playlist on Python Classes created by Corey Schafer - [Python OOP Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc )

The six videos were extremely helpful during my introductory days of studying Python after spending the past few years focusing on JavaScript.
